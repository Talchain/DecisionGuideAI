        **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES**

        If this is a **critical security vulnerability** that could lead to:
        - Remote code execution
        - Data breaches
        - Authentication bypass
        - Privilege escalation

        **DO NOT create a public issue.** Instead:
        1. Contact our security team directly at [security@yourcompany.com]
        2. Use GitHub's private security reporting feature
        3. Encrypt sensitive details with our PGP key

        This public template is only for **low-risk security improvements** and **security hardening suggestions**.
