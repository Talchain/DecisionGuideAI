# Summary
echo "üéâ Key Rotation Complete"
echo "========================"
echo "‚úÖ Zero downtime achieved"
echo "‚úÖ All requests successfully handled during transition"
echo "‚úÖ Old key safely disabled"
echo "‚úÖ Security improved with new key"
echo

# Best Practices Summary
echo "üõ°Ô∏è  Best Practices Demonstrated:"
echo "  1. Always maintain overlap window for zero downtime"
echo "  2. Monitor key usage before disabling old keys"
echo "  3. Verify new key works before disabling old key"
echo "  4. Have rollback plan (can re-enable old key if needed)"
echo "  5. Log all authentication attempts during rotation"
echo

# Rollback Scenario
echo "üö® Rollback Scenario (if needed):"
echo "  If new key fails: re-enable old key immediately"
echo "  Command: export API_KEY_PRIMARY=\"${OLD_KEY}\""
echo "  Impact: Instant fallback to working authentication"
