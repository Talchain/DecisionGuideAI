## Objective Gates Assessment

### üîí Contract Stability Gates
| Gate | Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Frozen SSE Events** | Events limited to: `hello\|token\|cost\|done\|cancelled\|limited\|error` | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Post-delivery validation confirmed immutable event set |
| **Resume-Once Semantics** | State management prevents duplicate resume attempts | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Deterministic replay tested with seed 42 consistency |
| **Report v1 Schema** | All reports include `"schema":"report.v1"` with meta.seed echo | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Schema compliance validated across all report outputs |
| **API Endpoint Shapes** | No breaking changes to existing endpoint contracts | ‚úÖ **PASS** | All new endpoints additive-only, existing shapes unchanged |

### ‚ö° Performance Gates
| Gate | Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Cancel Latency** | Cancel operations ‚â§150ms | ‚ùå **FAIL** | Current: 191ms (26% over threshold) |
| **TTFF Response** | Time to first token ‚â§500ms | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Current: 83ms (83% under threshold) |
| **P95 Latency** | 95th percentile response ‚â§600ms | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Current: 554ms (8% under threshold) |
| **Error Rate** | System error rate ‚â§5% | ‚ùå **BORDERLINE** | Current: 5.04% (0.7% over threshold) |

### üîê Privacy & Security Gates
| Gate | Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| **CORS Policy** | Closed by default, explicit allowlisting | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Default origins restricted, environment-configurable |
| **Request Logging** | No request body logging for privacy protection | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Validated: request bodies excluded from all logs |
| **Security Headers** | X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options configured | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Headers validation passed |
| **Crypto Defaults** | Snapshot signing OFF by default | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Requires explicit `SNAPSHOT_SIGNING_KEY` to enable |

### üß™ Validation Gates
| Gate | Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Post-Delivery Tests** | All 11 validation points pass | ‚úÖ **PASS** | 11/11 validations successful |
| **Feature Flag Safety** | All powerful features gated by environment | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Ops console, signing, toggles properly gated |
| **Evidence Generation** | Auto-brief system operational | ‚úÖ **PASS** | Latest brief generated successfully |
| **Backwards Compatibility** | No breaking changes for existing users | ‚úÖ **PASS** | All features additive-only |

## Risk Assessment

### üî¥ High Risk Issues
1. **Cancel Latency Threshold Exceeded**: 191ms vs 150ms target
   - **Impact**: User experience degradation for cancellation workflows
   - **Mitigation**: Performance optimisation required post-pilot
   - **Accept Risk?**: ‚ùì **DECISION REQUIRED**

2. **Error Rate at Threshold Boundary**: 5.04% vs 5.0% target
   - **Impact**: Slightly elevated error rate
   - **Mitigation**: Monitoring increased, trend analysis ongoing
   - **Accept Risk?**: ‚ùì **DECISION REQUIRED**

### üü° Medium Risk Issues
- **Live Gateway Testing**: Requires manual setup for full stream validation
- **Historical SLO Data**: Limited trending data available (insufficient historical baseline)

### üü¢ Low Risk Issues
- **New Feature Learning Curve**: Operators require familiarisation with pilot controls
- **Evidence Brief Tuning**: May require adjustment based on operational feedback

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ **GO Recommendation** (Conditional)
This release is **RECOMMENDED FOR PILOT DEPLOYMENT** with the following conditions:

1. **Accept Performance Risk**: Acknowledge 26% cancel latency overage as acceptable for pilot phase
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Deploy with increased SLO monitoring and alerting
3. **Quick Optimisation Path**: Commit to post-pilot performance improvements within 2 weeks

### Alternative Options
- **CONDITIONAL GO**: Deploy with performance caveats documented
- **NO-GO**: Require performance optimisation before pilot deployment
- **STAGED GO**: Limited pilot scope with performance-sensitive workflows excluded
