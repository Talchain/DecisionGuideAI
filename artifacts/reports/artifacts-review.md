**Files Scanned**: 245

## Amber Items Resolution

| Finding | Severity | File | Status | Resolution | Owner | Next Action |
|---------|----------|------|--------|------------|-------|-------------|
| Token detected in demo HTML | ðŸŸ  High | artifacts/windsurf-handover-bundle/demo-offline.html:306 | âœ… RESOLVED | False positive - "token" is simulation stream data field name, not authentication token | Security Review | None required |
| Token detected in pilot pack | ðŸŸ  High | artifacts/pilot-pack/windsurf-handover-bundle/demo-offline.html:306 | âœ… RESOLVED | Same as above - simulation data field, not credential | Security Review | None required |
| Street address pattern | ðŸ”µ Low | artifacts/pilot-success-criteria.md:8 | âœ… RESOLVED | False positive - "< 2 minutes" text pattern misidentified as address | Documentation Team | None required |
| Street address pattern in pack | ðŸ”µ Low | artifacts/pilot-pack/pilot-success-criteria.md:8 | âœ… RESOLVED | Same as above - time duration pattern, not address | Documentation Team | None required |

## Detailed Analysis

### High Severity Items

#### 1. "Token" Detection in Demo Files
- **Issue**: Scanner flagged `token: sampleTokens[i]` as potential credential
- **Analysis**: This is legitimate simulation code that streams text tokens to demo UI
- **Evidence**: Context shows `tokenIndex`, `timestamp`, `model` - clearly streaming data structure
- **Resolution**: âœ… No action required - this is safe demo simulation code
- **Risk Level**: None (false positive)

#### 2. Duplicate in Pilot Pack
- **Issue**: Same token detection in pilot pack copy of demo file
- **Analysis**: Identical to item #1 - pilot pack contains copy of safe demo file
- **Resolution**: âœ… No action required - inherited false positive
- **Risk Level**: None (false positive)

### Low Severity Items

#### 3. Street Address Pattern in Success Criteria
- **Issue**: Scanner flagged "< 2 minutes" as potential street address
- **Analysis**: This is a time duration specification, not geographic information
- **Evidence**: Context: "Target: < 2 minutes from landing to first analysis result"
- **Resolution**: âœ… No action required - legitimate time measurement documentation
- **Risk Level**: None (false positive)

#### 4. Duplicate in Pilot Pack
- **Issue**: Same address pattern in pilot pack copy
- **Analysis**: Identical to item #3 - pilot pack contains copy of safe documentation
- **Resolution**: âœ… No action required - inherited false positive
- **Risk Level**: None (false positive)

## Security Assessment

### âœ… No Real Security Issues Found

All amber findings are false positives from pattern matching:
- "token" refers to text stream tokens, not authentication tokens
- "< 2 minutes" is a time duration, not an address
- All flagged items are legitimate simulation/documentation content

### âœ… Validation Steps Completed

1. **Manual Review**: Each flagged line examined in context
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Confirmed all matches are legitimate use cases
3. **Risk Assessment**: No actual credentials or PII present
4. **Scope Check**: All items are in safe simulation/documentation files

## Final Recommendation

**Status**: âœ… **ALL CLEAR FOR PILOT DEPLOYMENT**

- No code changes required
- No security remediation needed
- All amber items are scanner false positives
- Pilot pack contents remain safe for distribution

## Actions Taken

- [x] Reviewed all 4 amber findings
- [x] Verified no real credentials present
- [x] Confirmed simulation code safety
- [x] Validated documentation accuracy
- [x] Documented resolution rationale

**Next Review**: None required - all items resolved as false positives
