# Safe Screen Crash Fix - Complete ✅

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING

---

## 🐛 Problem

On `/#/canvas`, the safe screen was crashing with:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'useState')
use-sync-external-store-shim.production.js:17
```

**Root cause**: The safe entry was accidentally importing React/Zustand dependencies due to recent chunking changes, causing `use-sync-external-store` to load before React was initialized.

---

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Isolated Safe Entry (React-Free)
Created pure DOM-only safe entry files:
- `src/poc/safe/safe-entry.ts` - Pure DOM manipulation, zero React
- `src/poc/safe/safe-utils.ts` - Helper utilities, React-free

### 2. Fixed Boot Logic
Updated `index.html` to:
- Check `forceSafe=1` parameter before loading React
- Only set timeout/error handlers when NOT in forced safe mode
- Prevent React from loading when `forceSafe=1` is present

### 3. React Deduplication
Updated `vite.config.ts`:
```typescript
resolve: {
  dedupe: ['react', 'react-dom', 'use-sync-external-store']
},
optimizeDeps: {
  include: ['use-sync-external-store']
}
```

### 4. ESLint Guard
Added `.eslintrc.cjs` override to prevent future regressions:
```javascript
{
  files: ['src/poc/safe/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
  rules: {
    'no-restricted-imports': ['error', {
      paths: ['react', 'react-dom', 'zustand', 'reactflow', '@xyflow/react', '@sentry/react'],
      patterns: ['**/store*', '**/ReactFlow*', '**/*ErrorBoundary*']
    }]
  }
}
```

### 5. E2E Regression Tests
Created `e2e/safe-screen.spec.ts` with 3 tests:
1. **Happy path**: Canvas loads, no safe screen, no sync-external-store errors
2. **Forced safe**: `?forceSafe=1` shows safe screen without importing React
3. **Timeout fallback**: Safe screen shows if React fails to mount

---

## 📊 Test Results

```
Running 3 tests using 1 worker

✓ happy path: canvas loads, no safe screen, no sync-external-store errors (3.2s)
✓ forced safe: safe screen renders without importing React (2.2s)
✓ safe screen shows on timeout if React fails to mount (2.0s)

3 passed (9.8s)
```

## 🔧 Files Changed

### Created
- `src/poc/safe/safe-entry.ts` - Pure DOM safe screen
- `src/poc/safe/safe-utils.ts` - React-free utilities
- `e2e/safe-screen.spec.ts` - Regression tests

### Modified
- `index.html` - Fixed boot logic with `forceSafe` support
- `vite.config.ts` - Added React deduplication
- `.eslintrc.cjs` - Added safe entry import restrictions
- `package.json` - Added `e2e:safe` script

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [x] `npm run lint` - ESLint passes with safe entry guards
- [x] `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript compiles cleanly
- [x] `npm run e2e:safe` - All 3 tests passing
- [x] `/#/canvas` loads without safe screen
- [x] `/?forceSafe=1#/canvas` shows safe screen without React errors
- [x] No `use-sync-external-store` errors in console

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **Isolation**: Safe entry completely decoupled from React/Zustand/React Flow
2. **Deduplication**: Vite ensures single React instance across all chunks
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive E2E tests prevent regression
4. **Lint Guard**: ESLint prevents accidental React imports in safe code
5. **Boot Logic**: Clean separation between safe mode and React mode

---

## 📝 Usage

### Normal Mode
```
/#/canvas
```
- React loads normally
- Safe screen hidden (display:none)
- Full app functionality

### Forced Safe Mode (Testing)
```
/?forceSafe=1#/canvas
```
- Safe screen shows immediately
- React never loads
- Zero dependencies
- No sync-external-store errors

### Fallback Mode (Auto)
If React fails to mount within 1200ms:
- Safe screen appears automatically
- Health check runs
- User sees status instead of blank page
