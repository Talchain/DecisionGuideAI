Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
          <div className="mt-6 pt-6 border-t">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Options Analysis</h3>
            <ProsConsList options={options} />
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The file was missing several closing brackets at the end. I've added:

1. Closing div for the "Options Render Section"
2. Closing div for the main content area
3. Closing div for the flex container
4. Final closing parenthesis and curly brace for the component

The structure is now properly nested and complete.
